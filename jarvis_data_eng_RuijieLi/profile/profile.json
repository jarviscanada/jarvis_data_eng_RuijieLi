Aside from some features that everyone had to do as part of the class (e.g. buttons and debouncing), I mostly worked on the following features: measuring distance with sonars (due to COVID, it was done in Simulink instead of actual sonars), controlling the LEDs, and CTC.",

The features I worked on are: straight lines (with points between segments), aerosol, bucket fill (left click to color all connected pixels with similar color, right click to color all pixels with similar color), polygons (number of edges adjustable), part of free from selection, parts of undo/redo, and unit testing.",
