summary: "I am looking for an opportunity as a full-stack developer. I have a bachelor's degree in software engineering from Polytechnique Montreal and about a year of work experience in software development, both in backend and frontend development. I am proactive, and I enjoy solving problems and building stuff. I am familiar with C++ (one project on embedded programming, one class on Linux OS, and OOP & design patterns), Python (performance optimization), JavaScript (frontend development), CSS (responsive design), and TypeScript (Angular for frontend, Node.js for backend) from academic and work experience."

    description: "Wrote a C++ program that allows a robot to complete an obstacle course. Aside from some features that everyone had to do as part of the class (e.g. buttons and debouncing), I mostly worked on the following features: measuring distance with sonars (due to COVID, it was done in Simulink instead of actual sonars), controlling the LEDs, and CTC."
  - name: "Browser drawing app"
    git_url:
    description: "Made a drawing app similar to Microsoft Paint in Angular TypeScript. The features I worked on are: straight lines (with points between segments), aerosol, bucket fill (left click to color all connected pixels with similar color, right click to color all pixels with similar color), polygons (number of edges adjustable), part of free from selection, parts of undo/redo, and unit testing."
  - name: "Cross-platform collaborative drawing app"
    git_url:
    description: "Made a chatting feature on Android that allows users to send messages in different channels (some groups are public, others are only for people drawing on the same picture). The Android app was written in Kotlin and the Firebase was used as a database."
  - name: "UI for a transit simulator"
    git_url:
    description: "Worked on the user interface (written in TypeScript / Angular) for a transit simulator made by the client (written in Python). I worked on deployment and package diagrams and the following features: displaying the events generated by the backend while a simulation is running, connecting the frontend and the backend with a message queue (ActiveMQ running in Docker), and pause/continue/stop simulation."
  - name: "PolyStar computer vision team"
    git_url:
    description: "Worked on a robotics project where the goal was to shoot the other team's robots. I wrote a program to split 1920x1080 images into 1080x720 images based on XML data, annotated 200 pictures for the machine learning algorithm, and wrote a program to detect the color of an LED in a picture (return gray if it is off, return red or blue if it is on)."

    duration: "2019"
    description: "Made a telecommunication simulator written in Python run up to 65% faster (~1300 seconds to less than 500 seconds in one particular configuration) and use up to 50% less memory (~12-15GB less in one case) by implementing multiprocessing, removing certain function calls and @property, using the __slots__ attribute, avoiding calling scipy.rvs() in a loop, and avoiding copying large amounts of data between processes. Further attempts to optimize it with shared memory (BaseManager) and Boost.Python (translating part of the code to C++) were unsuccessful due to high overhead."
